# fork-repository

This page goes through the workflow to fork a repository on Github.

# Introduction

Github is a open platform allows anyone to collaborate in all open source projects. However, it does not means you can do whatever you want. You are only allowed to manipulate codes under your accounts or projects with assigned permissions. 

In order to make changes to projects owned by others, you must first **Fork** it into your account. Make changes and open Pull Request to ask the owner merging your changes from your repository.

# Exercise

Github created a [repository](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife) for practicing. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) for more details.
